# Expense Tracker App

Hello! This is my expense tracker application built with React. I made this project to help people track their daily expenses and manage their money better.

## What is this app?

This app helps you to:
- Track your daily expenses 
- Manage different categories like Food, Travel, Shopping etc
- Split expenses with friends and family
- Set savings goals
- View reports and charts of your spending

## Technologies I used

- **React** - For building the user interface
- **Firebase** - For database and authentication  
- **CSS** - For styling and making it look good
- **Vite** - For fast development
- **Chart.js/Recharts** - For showing beautiful charts

## How to run this project on your computer

### Step 1: Download the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sravani-0103/expense-tracker
cd expense-tracker
```

### Step 2: Install all packages
First make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Then run:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Setup Firebase
1. Go to Firebase website and create a new project
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore Database
3. Copy your Firebase config
4. Create a file called `firebase.js` in `src` folder
5. Paste your config there

### Step 4: Start the app
```bash
npm run dev
```

Now open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app!
